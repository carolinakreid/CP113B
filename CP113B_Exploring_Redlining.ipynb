    "In this datascience module, we're going to explore the relationship between historical patterns of redlining and concentrated poverty today.  Community and economic development is fundamentally about bringing investment back to high-poverty areas due to lack of access to credit and other forms of capital.  It recognizes that poverty is in part due to structural--not individual--causes.  So let's look at how past policies that contributed to disinvestment of minority neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s still influence our cities today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of today's module, we're going to introduce you to the Jupyter Notebook.  We'll then look at some redlining maps, and discuss them as a group.  Finally, we'll analyze whether areas that were indicated as being \"high risk\" on the map have higher rates of poverty today."
